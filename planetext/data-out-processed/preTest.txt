   In the complex plane, the frequency response of a univariate polynomial is the set of values taken by the polynomial when evaluated along the imaginary axis. 
This is an algebraic curve partitioning the plane into several connected components. 
In this note it is shown that the component including the origin is exactly representable by a linear matrix inequality if and only if the polynomial is stable, in the sense that all its roots have negative real parts

 Let  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-s math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:element-of math-blackboard-R math-OPEN:[ math-italic-s math-CLOSE:]  be a polynomial of the complex indeterminate  math-italic-s math-RELOP:element-of math-blackboard-C . 
We say that  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-s math-CLOSE:)  is stable if all its roots lie in the open left half-plane. 
Define the frequency response as the set of values taken by the polynomial when evaluated along the stability boundary, namely the imaginary axis. 
The frequency response plays a key role when deriving results of robust control theory such as Kharitonov’s theorem . 
In it was observed that the frequency response of a stable polynomial features interesting convexity properties, see also . 
More specifically, given a polynomial  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-s math-CLOSE:) , an arc is defined as a subset of the frequency response for a given range of the indeterminate, i.e.  math-OPEN:{ math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-j math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:) math-METARELOP:colon math-italic-omega math-RELOP:element-of math-Omega math-CLOSE:}  with  math-Omega  a subset of the real line  math-blackboard-R . 
A proper arc is an arc that does not pass through the origin and such that the net change in the argument of  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-j math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:)  does not exceed  math-italic-pi  as  math-italic-omega  increases over  math-Omega . 
The Arc Convexity Theorem of states that all proper arcs of the value set of a stable polynomial are convex. 
Alternative proofs can be found in and . 
The frequency response  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P  is a curve that partitions the complex plane into several connected components. 
We denote by  math-caligraphic-P  the connected component including the origin. 
It is called the inner frequency response set in . 
In the case of a stable polynomial, the boundary of  math-caligraphic-P  therefore consists of a finite union of proper arcs. 
Theorem 4.1 in uses the Arc Convexity Theorem to establish convexity of  math-caligraphic-P . 
In this note we provide a more accurate description of the geometry of  math-caligraphic-P  and an alternative proof of its convexity. 
We derive an explicit representation of this set as a two-dimensional linear matrix inequality (LMI). 
Instrumental to this derivation are standard results from real algebraic geometry and a recent characterization of two-dimensional convex polynomial level sets obtained in . 
 The frequency response of polynomial  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-s math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-italic-p math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:0 math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:plus math-italic-p math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:1 math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-italic-s math-ADDOP:plus math-ID:cdots math-ADDOP:plus math-italic-p math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-n math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-italic-n math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end  can be expressed as the parametric curve where and are polynomials of the real indeterminate  math-italic-omega math-RELOP:element-of math-blackboard-R . 
Curve  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P  is rationally (here polynomially) parametrized, so it is an algebraic plane curve of genus zero . 
In control theory terminology,  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P  is sometimes called the Mikhailov plot of polynomial  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-s math-CLOSE:)  or the Nyquist plot of the rational (here polynomial) transfer function  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-s math-CLOSE:) , see or . 
Equations (-) provide a parametric description of curve  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P . 
With the help of elimination theory and resultants, we can derive an implicit description where  math-italic-f math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:)  is an irreducible bivariate polynomial, see . 
To address the implicitization problem, we make use of a particular resultant, the Bézoutian, see e.g. or . 
Given two univariate polynomials  math-italic-g math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:) math-PUNCT:, math-italic-h math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:)  of the same degree  math-italic-n  as in Lemma , build the following bivariate polynomial called the Bézoutian of  math-italic-g  and  math-italic-h , and the corresponding symmetric matrix  math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-g math-PUNCT:, math-italic-h math-CLOSE:)  of size  math-italic-n math-MULOP:times math-italic-n  with entries  math-italic-b math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-k math-italic-l math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end  bilinear in coefficients of  math-italic-g  and  math-italic-h . 
As shown e.g. in or , the determinant of the Bézoutian matrix is the resultant:  math-LIMITOP:determinant math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-g math-PUNCT:, math-italic-h math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-italic-b math-OPEN:( math-italic-g math-PUNCT:, math-italic-h math-CLOSE:)  Now we can use the Bézoutian to derive the implicit equation () of curve  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P  from the explicit equations (-). 
Rewrite the system of equations () as and use the Bézoutian resultant of Lemma to eliminate indeterminate  math-italic-omega  and obtain conditions for a point  math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:)  to belong to the curve. 
The Bézoutian matrix is  math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-g math-PUNCT:, math-italic-h math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:minus math-italic-x math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-z math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-PUNCT:, math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-y math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:minus math-italic-y math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-z math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-PUNCT:, math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-z math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-CLOSE:) math-ADDOP:minus math-italic-x math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-y math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-PUNCT:, math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-z math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-CLOSE:) math-ADDOP:minus math-italic-y math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-PUNCT:, math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-z math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-CLOSE:) . 
Linearity in  math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y  follows from bilinearity of the Bézoutian. 
Finally, note that the sign of  math-italic-F math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-ADDOP:plus-or-minus math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-g math-PUNCT:, math-italic-h math-CLOSE:)  affects the sign of  math-italic-f , but not the implicit description  math-italic-f math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-NUMBER:0 .
 math-Box  Lemma provides the implicit equation of curve  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P  in symmetric linear determinantal form. 
 Curve  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P  partitions the complex plane into several connected regions. 
We are interested in the connected region containing the origin, denoted by  math-caligraphic-P . 
In order to study the geometry of this region, we need the following result. 
The signature of the Bézoutian matrix  math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-PUNCT:, math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-y math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-CLOSE:) , (the number of positive eigenvalues minus the number of negative eigenvalues) is equal to the Cauchy index of the rational function  math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:) math-MULOP:divide math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-y math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:)  (the number of jumps from  math-ADDOP:minus math-ID:infinity  to  math-ADDOP:plus math-ID:infinity  minus the number of jumps from  math-ADDOP:plus math-ID:infinity  to  math-ADDOP:minus math-ID:infinity ), see . 
The Cauchy index is maximum (resp. minimum) when  math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-PUNCT:, math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-z math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-CLOSE:)  is positive (resp. negative) definite. 
This occurs if and only if polynomials  math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end  and  math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-y math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end  satisfy the root interlacing condition, i.e. they must have only real roots and between two roots of  math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:)  there is only one root of  math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-y math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:)  and vice-versa. 
Since  math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-Re math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-j math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:)  and  math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-y math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-Im math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-j math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:) , this is equivalent to stability of  math-italic-p  in virtue of the Hermite-Biehler theorem, see or .
 math-Box  The main result of this note can now be stated. 
First we prove that  math-italic-p  stable implies LMI representability of  math-caligraphic-P . 
This set is the closure of the connected component of the polynomial level set  math-OPEN:{ math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-METARELOP:colon math-italic-f math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:greater-than math-NUMBER:0 math-CLOSE:}  that contains the origin, an algebraic interior in the terminology of . 
Polynomial  math-italic-f math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:)  is called the defining polynomial. 
By continuity, the boundary of  math-caligraphic-P  consists of those points  math-italic-x math-ADDOP:plus math-italic-j math-italic-y  for which  math-italic-F math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:)  drops rank while staying positive semidefinite. 
Note that in general this boundary is only a subset of the curve  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P . 
To prove the converse, namely that LMI representability of  math-caligraphic-P  implies stability of  math-italic-p , we use a result of stating that a two-dimensional algebraic interior containing the origin has an LMI representation if and only if it is rigidly convex. 
Geometrically, this means that a generic line passing through the origin must intersect the algebraic curve  math-italic-f math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-NUMBER:0  a number of times equal to the degree of  math-italic-f math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:) . 
Rigid convexity implies that  math-italic-x math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:)  and  math-italic-y math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:) , the respective real and imaginary parts of polynomial  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-j math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:) , satisfy the root interlacing property, and this implies stability of  math-italic-p  by the Hermite-Biehler Theorem used already in the proof of Lemma . 
 math-Box    Let  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-s math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:3 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:plus math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:2 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:plus math-NUMBER:4 math-italic-s math-ADDOP:plus math-NUMBER:1 . 
Then  math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-NUMBER:1 math-ADDOP:minus math-italic-omega math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:2 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end  and  math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-y math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-OPEN:( math-italic-omega math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-NUMBER:4 math-italic-omega math-ADDOP:minus math-italic-omega math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:3 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end  in parametrization (). 
With the help of the Control System Toolbox for Matlab, a visual representation of curve  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P  can be obtained as follows: see Figure . 
The Bézoutian matrices of Lemma can be computed with the following Maple 10 instructions: Note the use of the instruction to ensure that the last Bézoutian matrix has appropriate dimension 3. Matrix  math-italic-B math-OPEN:( math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-x math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-PUNCT:, math-italic-q math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:start math-italic-z math-POSTSUBSCRIPT:end math-CLOSE:)  is negative definite, so a sign change is required to build and we obtain the following determinantal polynomial: describing algebraic plane curve  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P  implicitly. 
The curve can be studied with the package of Maple:  A more complicated example is the eighth degree stable polynomial  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-s math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-NUMBER:336 math-ADDOP:plus math-NUMBER:198 math-italic-s math-ADDOP:plus math-NUMBER:496 math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:2 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:plus math-NUMBER:117 math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:3 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:plus math-NUMBER:183 math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:4 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:plus math-NUMBER:20 math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:5 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:plus math-NUMBER:24 math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:6 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:plus math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:7 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:plus math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:8 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end  whose frequency response is represented on Figure . 
The rigidly convex region around the origin has the LMI description  This example is taken from . 
Let  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-s math-CLOSE:) math-RELOP:equals math-italic-s math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:start math-NUMBER:4 math-POSTSUPERSCRIPT:end math-ADDOP:minus math-italic-s math-ADDOP:minus math-NUMBER:1 . 
The implicit equation of  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P  is The component  math-caligraphic-P  including the origin is convex, see Figure , but it is not rigidly convex since a generic line passing through the origin cuts the quartic  math-OPERATOR:partial-differential math-caligraphic-P  only twice. 
Hence this region does not admit an LMI representation, and by Theorem , polynomial  math-italic-p math-OPEN:( math-italic-s math-CLOSE:)  is unstable. 
Note however that  math-caligraphic-P  can be represented as the projection of an LMI set: by introducing a lifting variable  math-italic-z , but such constructions are out of the scope of this note. 
 Convexity of the connected component containing the origin and delimited by the frequency response of a stable polynomial was already established in . 
In this note we give an alternative proof of this result based on Bézoutians and we give a more accurate characterization of the geometry of this region. 
Namely, the region is rigidly convex in the sense of , a property which is stronger than convexity, and which is equivalent to the existence of an LMI representation of the set. 
In the terminology of convex analysis, the polynomial  math-italic-f math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:)  defining implicitly the frequency response in () is hyperbolic with respect to the origin. 
Equivalently,  math-italic-f math-OPEN:( math-italic-x math-PUNCT:, math-italic-y math-CLOSE:)  can be expressed as the determinant of a symmetric pencil which is positive definite at the origin. 
See for a tutorial on hyperbolic polynomials and for connections with the results of . 
This note therefore unveils a link between polynomial hyperbolicity and stability.
