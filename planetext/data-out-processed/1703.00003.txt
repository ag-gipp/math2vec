Let math-n and math-r be positive integers and let math-j. Let math-n and math-r be positive integers and let math-r.  Then math-C is a polynomial in math-q with nonnegative integer coefficients.  Then math-n is a polynomial in math-q with nonnegative integer coefficients.  Then math-q is a polynomial in math-q with nonnegative integer coefficients.  Then math-k is a polynomial in math-q with nonnegative integer coefficients.  Then math-j is a polynomial in math-q with nonnegative integer coefficients.  Then math-N is a polynomial in math-q with nonnegative integer coefficients.  Then math-r is a polynomial in math-q with nonnegative integer coefficients. 
Note that the upper bound math-r of math-j in Conjecture 3. 2 seems to be the best possible.  Numerical calculation implies that Conjecture 3. 2 does not hold when math-j. 2 does not hold when math-r.  Furthermore, we have the following generalization of Conjecture 3. 2.
