   __H1_0__  __H6_0__ In the complex plane, the frequency response of a univariate polynomial is the set of values taken by the polynomial when evaluated along the imaginary axis. This is an algebraic curve partitioning the plane into several connected components. In this note it is shown that the component including the origin is exactly representable by a linear matrix inequality if and only if the polynomial is stable, in the sense that all its roots have negative real parts.

We say that __MATH_2__ is stable if all its roots lie in the open left half-plane. Define the frequency response  as the set of values taken by the polynomial when evaluated along the stability boundary, namely the imaginary axis. The frequency response plays a key role when deriving results of robust control theory such as Kharitonov’s theorem . In  it was observed that the frequency response of a stable polynomial features interesting convexity properties, see also . More specifically, given a polynomial __MATH_3__, an arc is defined as a subset of the frequency response for a given range of the indeterminate, i.e. __MATH_4__ with __MATH_5__ a subset of the real line __MATH_6__. A proper arc is an arc that does not pass through the origin and such that the net change in the argument of __MATH_7__ does not exceed __MATH_8__ as __MATH_9__ increases over __MATH_10__. The Arc Convexity Theorem of  states that all proper arcs of the value set of a stable polynomial are convex. Alternative proofs can be found in  and . The frequency response __MATH_11__ is a curve that partitions the complex plane into several connected components. We denote by __MATH_12__ the connected component including the origin. It is called the inner frequency response set in . In the case of a stable polynomial, the boundary of __MATH_13__ therefore consists of a finite union of proper arcs. Theorem 4.1 in  uses the Arc Convexity Theorem to establish convexity of __MATH_14__. In this note we provide a more accurate description of the geometry of __MATH_15__ and an alternative proof of its convexity. We derive an explicit representation of this set as a two-dimensional linear matrix inequality (LMI). Instrumental to this derivation are standard results from real algebraic geometry  and a recent characterization of two-dimensional convex polynomial level sets obtained in . __H2_1__ The frequency response of polynomial __MATH_16__ can be expressed as the parametric curve  where  and  are polynomials of the real indeterminate __MATH_17__. Curve __MATH_18__ is rationally (here polynomially) parametrized, so it is an algebraic plane curve of genus zero . In control theory terminology, __MATH_19__ is sometimes called the Mikhailov plot of polynomial __MATH_20__ or the Nyquist plot of the rational (here polynomial) transfer function __MATH_21__, see  or . Equations (-) provide a parametric description of curve __MATH_22__. With the help of elimination theory and resultants, we can derive an implicit description  where __MATH_23__ is an irreducible bivariate polynomial, see .   To address the implicitization problem, we make use of a particular resultant, the Bézoutian, see e.g.  or . Given two univariate polynomials __MATH_24__ of the same degree __MATH_25__ as in Lemma , build the following bivariate polynomial  called the Bézoutian of __MATH_26__ and __MATH_27__, and the corresponding symmetric matrix __MATH_28__ of size __MATH_29__ with entries __MATH_30__ bilinear in coefficients of __MATH_31__ and __MATH_32__. As shown e.g. in  or , the determinant of the Bézoutian matrix is the resultant:  __MATH_33__ Now we can use the Bézoutian to derive the implicit equation () of curve __MATH_34__ from the explicit equations (-).      Rewrite the system of equations () as  and use the Bézoutian resultant of Lemma  to eliminate indeterminate __MATH_35__ and obtain conditions for a point __MATH_36__ to belong to the curve. The Bézoutian matrix is __MATH_37__. Linearity in __MATH_38__ follows from bilinearity of the Bézoutian. Finally, note that the sign of __MATH_39__ affects the sign of __MATH_40__, but not the implicit description __MATH_41__.__MATH_42__ Lemma  provides the implicit equation of curve __MATH_43__ in symmetric linear determinantal form. __H2_2__ Curve __MATH_44__ partitions the complex plane into several connected regions. We are interested in the connected region containing the origin, denoted by __MATH_45__. In order to study the geometry of this region, we need the following result.    The signature of the Bézoutian matrix __MATH_46__, (the number of positive eigenvalues minus the number of negative eigenvalues) is equal to the Cauchy index of the rational function __MATH_47__ (the number of jumps from __MATH_48__ to __MATH_49__ minus the number of jumps from __MATH_50__ to __MATH_51__), see . The Cauchy index is maximum (resp. minimum) when __MATH_52__ is positive (resp. negative) definite. This occurs if and only if polynomials __MATH_53__ and __MATH_54__ satisfy the root interlacing condition, i.e. they must have only real roots and between two roots of __MATH_55__ there is only one root of __MATH_56__ and vice-versa. Since __MATH_57__ and __MATH_58__, this is equivalent to stability of __MATH_59__ in virtue of the Hermite-Biehler theorem, see  or .__MATH_60__ The main result of this note can now be stated.      First we prove that __MATH_61__ stable implies LMI representability of __MATH_62__. This set is the closure of the connected component of the polynomial level set __MATH_63__ that contains the origin, an algebraic interior in the terminology of . Polynomial __MATH_64__ is called the defining polynomial. By continuity, the boundary of __MATH_65__ consists of those points __MATH_66__ for which __MATH_67__ drops rank while staying positive semidefinite. Note that in general this boundary is only a subset of the curve __MATH_68__. To prove the converse, namely that LMI representability of __MATH_69__ implies stability of __MATH_70__, we use a result of  stating that a two-dimensional algebraic interior containing the origin has an LMI representation if and only if it is rigidly convex. Geometrically, this means that a generic line passing through the origin must intersect the algebraic curve __MATH_71__ a number of times equal to the degree of __MATH_72__. Rigid convexity implies that __MATH_73__ and __MATH_74__, the respective real and imaginary parts of polynomial __MATH_75__, satisfy the root interlacing property, and this implies stability of __MATH_76__ by the Hermite-Biehler Theorem used already in the proof of Lemma . __MATH_77__ __H2_3__ __H3_0__ Let __MATH_78__. Then __MATH_79__ and __MATH_80__ in parametrization (). With the help of the Control System Toolbox for Matlab, a visual representation of curve __MATH_81__ can be obtained as follows:  see Figure .  The Bézoutian matrices of Lemma  can be computed with the following Maple 10 instructions:  Note the use of the  instruction to ensure that the last Bézoutian matrix has appropriate dimension 3. Matrix __MATH_82__ is negative definite, so a sign change is required to build  and we obtain the following determinantal polynomial:  describing algebraic plane curve __MATH_83__ implicitly. The curve can be studied with the  package of Maple:  __H3_1__ A more complicated example is the eighth degree stable polynomial __MATH_84__ whose frequency response is represented on Figure . The rigidly convex region around the origin has the LMI description   __H3_2__ This example is taken from . Let __MATH_85__. The implicit equation of __MATH_86__ is  The component __MATH_87__ including the origin is convex, see Figure , but it is not rigidly convex since a generic line passing through the origin cuts the quartic __MATH_88__ only twice. Hence this region does not admit an LMI representation, and by Theorem , polynomial __MATH_89__ is unstable. Note however that __MATH_90__ can be represented as the projection of an LMI set:  by introducing a lifting variable __MATH_91__, but such constructions are out of the scope of this note.  __H2_4__ Convexity of the connected component containing the origin and delimited by the frequency response of a stable polynomial was already established in . In this note we give an alternative proof of this result based on Bézoutians and we give a more accurate characterization of the geometry of this region. Namely, the region is rigidly convex in the sense of , a property which is stronger than convexity, and which is equivalent to the existence of an LMI representation of the set. In the terminology of convex analysis, the polynomial __MATH_92__ defining implicitly the frequency response in () is hyperbolic with respect to the origin. Equivalently, __MATH_93__ can be expressed as the determinant of a symmetric pencil which is positive definite at the origin. See  for a tutorial on hyperbolic polynomials and  for connections with the results of . This note therefore unveils a link between polynomial hyperbolicity and stability. __H2_5__ This work benefited from discussions with Bernard Mourrain.
