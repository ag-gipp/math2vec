    __H1_0__  __H6_0__ We have carried out a major survey for visual binaries towards the Orion Nebula Cluster using HST images obtained with an H__MATH_0__ filter. Among 781 likely ONC members more than 60__MATH_1__ from __MATH_2__ Ori C, we find 78 multiple systems (75 binaries and 3 triples), of which 55 are new discoveries, in the range from 0__MATH_3__1 to 1__MATH_4__5. About 9 binaries are likely line-of-sight associations. We find a binary fraction of 8.8%__MATH_5__1.1% within the limited separation range from 67.5 to 675 AU. The field binary fraction in the same range is a factor 1.5 higher. Within the range 150 AU to 675 AU we find that T Tauri associations have a factor 2.2 more binaries than the ONC. The binary separation distribution function of the ONC shows unusual structure, with a sudden steep decrease in the number of binaries as the separation increases beyond 0__MATH_6__5, corresponding to 225 AU. We have measured the ratio of binaries wider than 0__MATH_7__5 to binaries closer than 0__MATH_8__5 as a function of distance from the Trapezium, and find that this ratio is significantly depressed in the inner region of the ONC. The deficit of wide binaries in the central part of the cluster is likely due to dissolution or orbital change during their passage through the potential well of the inner cluster region. Many of the companions are likely to be brown dwarfs.  __H2_0__ Since the first detection of pre-main sequence binaries by Joy & van Biesbroeck (1944) and Herbig (1962), major advances have been gained in our understanding of the formation and early evolution of binaries. One of the key results is that binaries are about twice as common in T Tauri associations as among field stars (e.g., Reipurth & Zinnecker 1993, Simon et al. 1995, Duchêne 1999, Ratzka et al. 2005). Studies of embedded sources suggest that multiple systems may possibly be more prevalent among Class I sources than among the more evolved T Tauri stars (e.g., Duchêne et al. 2004). Dynamical evolution among higher-order multiples is likely to be important during the embedded phase, leading to the occasional ejection of lower-mass members and the formation of powerful jets (Reipurth 2000). The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the nearest (d__MATH_9__450 pc) star forming cluster, with an age of less than 1 Myr, and it has been extensively studied at multiple wavelengths (e.g., Herbig & Terndrup 1986, Hillenbrand 1997, Getman et al. 2005 and references therein; for earlier work see the review by Herbig 1982). It is well known that the massive stars in the Trapezium have a very high binary frequency (e.g., Preibisch et al. 1999). Binarity of the low-mass population of the central part of the ONC has been studied extensively, and it has been suggested that the binary frequency is lower than for the dispersed low-mass young population in associations and comparable to the binary frequency in the field (Prosser et al. 1994, Padgett et al. 1997, Petr et al. 1998, Simon et al. 1999, Köhler et al. 2006). In this paper, we report the results of a major binary survey of an extensive region centered on the ONC, based on a large H__MATH_10__ imaging survey using the Hubble Space Telescope. We have detected 78 multiple systems, of which 55 are new discoveries, in an area of 412 arcmin__MATH_11__ that excludes a circular area with radius of 60__MATH_12__ centered on __MATH_13__ Ori C. We discuss the membership of these binaries in the ONC, analyze their binary properties, and discuss the binary separation distribution function and binary formation in the ONC. __H2_1__ The present survey is based on our recent study of the Orion Nebula using the Wide Field Camera of the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard HST. During program GO-9825, we observed 26 ACS fields with the F658N (H__MATH_14__+[NII]) filter and with an exposure time of 500 sec per pointing. In total our H__MATH_15__ survey covers an area of 415 arcmin__MATH_16__ of the central Orion Nebula. Due to the high stellar density near the Trapezium we have excluded a circular area with radius of 60__MATH_17__ centered on __MATH_18__ Ori C, so the area investigated is 412 arcmin__MATH_19__. The exquisite resolution of the HST combined with the 0__MATH_20__05 pixel-size of the ACS offers a unique opportunity to detect close binaries. We examined all stellar sources in the images by eye at a range of contrast levels, allowing us to pick up faint as well as bright companions. Thanks to the very stable point-spread function across the images, this could be done in a rather homogeneous fashion. We discuss the completeness of this procedure in Sect. 3.3. We used reduced images that were combined through MULTIDRIZZLE. The faintest star we measured had a magnitude of 21.5 in the F658 filter. Pixel coordinates for both primaries and secondaries were determined with 2-dimensional Gaussian functions, and separations and position angles calculated from these coordinates. Relative fluxes were determined using aperture photometry with corrections for the sky background. For further details of the observations, see Bally et al. (2006). __H2_2__ __H3_0__ The region of the ONC we have studied is shown in Figure 1, which outlines the mosaic of 26 ACS fields. One field had to be slightly turned to acquire a guidestar. We examined all stars (1051) in these fields with the exception of stars within an exclusion zone of 60__MATH_21__ around __MATH_22__ Ori C. __H3_1__ All previous HST studies of binarity in the ONC were done in the region around the Trapezium, where line-of-sight pairs due to the high stellar density is a major issue, and thus focused mostly on sub-arcsec binaries. In contrast, our study covers a much larger area including the outskirts of the ONC. We have also excluded the inner region with radius of 60__MATH_23__, so contamination is much less of an issue. Based on our observed star density, we can calculate the fraction of our binaries that are not physical pairs for different separation limits. From this we have chosen an upper separation limit of 1__MATH_24__5, which implies an 11% contamination, as described below. __H3_2__ We have tested our completeness of companions by blindly “observing” real stars with artificially added companions (scaled from real stars in the images) at random separations, position angles, and flux ratios. We find that our detections are essentially complete down to separations of 0__MATH_25__1, a result made possible by the very sharp point spread function of the HST/ACS system. Figure 2 shows two panels with plots of __MATH_26__m vs. separation in arcseconds. The left panel shows the actual observations of the binaries we detected, while the right panel shows our artificial binaries. Filled circles indicate companions we were able to identify, and empty circles indicate those we failed to see. Our detection limit is essentially complete to 0__MATH_27__1 except for the largest brightness differences, but very few binaries are found with large flux differences (see Sect. 4.5). To be certain that we are complete, we considered binary companions in the more limited separation range from 0__MATH_28__15 to 1__MATH_29__5. However, a much more severe problem with completeness is due to the strong and highly structured emission from the surrounding HII region, a problem that is compounded by our use of images taken through an H__MATH_30__ filter. In some areas, especially near the Trapezium, our ability to detect faint stars is diminished, an effect that is unquantifiable but should be kept in mind. Most binaries that have been found prior to this study were identified using infrared techniques. Whereas all binaries we have detected have been checked against lists of previously discovered binaries, we have not made any systematic effort to check if all these earlier binaries are also detectable in the optical. From random checks it appears that many of these infrared-detected binaries are not visible in our optical images. __H3_3__ The main source for membership information in the ONC are astrometric studies, principally the study by Jones & Walker (1988), which covers the inner 20__MATH_31____MATH_32__30__MATH_33__ of the ONC and thus includes our area of study. It is based on photographic I-band plates, which favors red and reddened stars. Of the 1051 stars in our images, 655 stars are listed in the Jones & Walker catalog, and of these 596 have membership probabilities higher than 93%. The large majority of our binaries are not resolved in the JW survey, and thus the proper motions can be affected by relative brightness variations of the components that can shift the photocenter. We have seen such variability in a binary lying in the overlap region between two fields, and thus observed twice. We have also found stars with clear pre-main sequence characteristics that have membership probability of 0%, indicating that astrometric information can be used to  membership, but should not be used to  membership. We are therefore complementing the proper motion membership analysis with other sources, such as X-ray emission, H__MATH_34__ emission, and variability. Getman et al. (2005) has determined that 1373 stars from the 1616 sources in the COUP survey, which largely overlaps with our field (see Figure 1), are Orion members. Among our stars, we find 658 which are detected by COUP and also are classified as ONC members. Finally, we use the presence of H__MATH_35__ emission (partly from the literature and from our own unpublished deep survey), as well as irregular variability as listed in the General Catalogue of Variable Stars. A total of 99 stars were found to have H__MATH_36__ emission. Note that we do not use near-infrared excess as a membership criterion, since our binaries by default are likely to have infrared excesses due to their mostly lower-mass companions. In total, we find 781 stars that have at least one (and commonly several) of these membership characteristics. __H3_4__ Among the 781 known ONC members detected in our HST images, we found 72 binaries and 3 triples in the range from 0__MATH_37__15 to 1__MATH_38__5. These are listed in Table 1, where each triple is listed as two binaries, in the manner of counting of Kuiper (1942). The first and second columns list the Jones & Walker ID and the probability of the star to be a member of the ONC based on its proper motion, respectively. The third column lists the Parenago number, the fourth column lists the name in the General Catalog of Variable Stars, the fifth column lists the COUP number, and the sixth column lists the number given by Hillenbrand (1997). The right ascension and declination for equinox 2000 are listed in the seventh and eighth columns. The ninth column lists the position angle of the system and the tenth column lists its separation in arcsec. The apparent magnitude in the I band (from Hillenbrand 1997) is listed in the eleventh column and the difference in magnitudes, in the H__MATH_39__ filter, between the primary and secondary is listed in the twelfth column. The position angle towards and separation (in arcsec) to __MATH_40__Ori C are listed in columns 13 and 14, respectively. Then follows the spectral type as listed by SIMBAD. The sixteenth column lists the character of membership for each binary (P: proper motion; X: COUP ONC source; H: H__MATH_41__ emission; V: irregular variable). The last column lists the discovery paper if a binary was known prior to this work. Additionally, we have found 3 binaries among the ONC members outside the 60__MATH_42__ exclusion zone with separations between 0__MATH_43__11 and 0__MATH_44__15. They are listed in Table 2. We have furthermore examined the optically visible ONC members within the exclusion zone, and have found another 3 binaries with separations less than 0__MATH_45__4, an (arbitrarily chosen) upper limit we imposed due to the high stellar density in that region. Two of these are new discoveries. Many more binaries have been found by earlier studies of the central region (e.g., Prosser et al. 1994, Padgett et al. 1997, Petr et al. 1998, Simon et al. 1999, Köhler et al. 2006), but most are only detectable in the infrared, since most cluster members are hidden by extinction; these three binaries are the only we could detect in our images in the range 0__MATH_46__1 - 0__MATH_47__4. We do not include the abovementioned binaries in our statistical analysis, but list them in Table 2. Finally, we have searched the 270 stars outside the exclusion zone for which we have no evidence for membership, and have found another 7 binaries. Some of these may be foreground or background stars, but others may turn out to be young stars, and we also list them in Table 2. The columns in Table 2 are the same as in Table 1, except we have added an additional column, which characterizes the binaries. All of our binaries with known spectral types are late-type stars, presumably classical and weak-line T Tauri stars, with the exception of Parenago 2149 (JW 945), which appears to be a Herbig Ae/Be star. In Figure 3a,b we show figures of the 78 multiple systems we have identified among ONC members outside the exclusion zone, as well as the three close binaries (__MATH_48__0__MATH_49__4) found inside the exclusion zone. Each stamp is 2__MATH_50__ on a side. Some of the binaries are particularly interesting for a variety of reasons, e.g. V1118 Ori is a famous EXor, other binaries or companions are likely substellar objects, and some are associated with jets or proplyds. In the Appendix, we provide more details about these cases. Could some of the wider binaries in the ONC be due to contamination by line-of-sight pairs? The surface density of stars in the ONC is a steeply declining function of distance from the center of the cluster, with only relatively minor fluctuations due to subclustering (either real or caused by extinction variations, Figure 4). We have determined the stellar density __MATH_51__ in an area with radius 30__MATH_52__ around each of the 781 ONC members, and have determined the probability __MATH_53__ of finding an unrelated star within a distance __MATH_54__ from each primary using the expression __MATH_55__ (Correia et al. 2006), where we have set __MATH_56__ to 1__MATH_57__5. The probability __MATH_58__ is principally a function of the distance from __MATH_59__ Ori C, with smaller variations due to local inhomogeneities in the cluster density. Figure 5 shows the distribution of probability of a line-of-sight association for each of the 781 ONC members as a function of distance from __MATH_60__ Ori C. The figure mostly follows the radial stellar density curve in Figure 4, although the effect of local small-scale groupings is visible. The sum of contamination probabilities for the 781 stars is 911%. In other words, among the binaries detected we are likely to have roughly 9 line-of-sight doubles. In the following we correct for these false binaries. __H2_3__ __H3_5__ The detection of 72 binaries and 3 triples with separations in the range 0__MATH_61__15 - 1__MATH_62__5 among the 781 ONC members must be corrected for the estimated 9 binaries that are likely to be due to line-of-sight pairing. Counting the three triples as six binaries, we then have 69 physical binaries, which implies a 8.8%__MATH_63__1.1% binary fraction __MATH_64__ in the interval from 67.5 to 675 AU, or a multiplicity frequency (where the 3 triples are counted as 1 system each) of 8.5%__MATH_65__1.1% (here and in the following the error estimates are 1__MATH_66__ and are derived using Poisson statistics). Petr et al. (1998) found 4 binaries in the separation range 0__MATH_67__14 to 0__MATH_68__5 in the inner 40__MATH_69____MATH_70__40__MATH_71__ of the Trapezium, corresponding to 5.9%__MATH_72__4.0%. In the same limited range of separations we find 50 binaries, corresponding to 6.4%__MATH_73__0.9%. The numbers are consistent within their errors. Reipurth & Zinnecker (1993) observed nearby T Tauri associations and found 38 binaries (of a sample of 238 stars) in the range 150-1800 AU. The range we study statistically is 67.5-675 AU. We have derived the number of binaries in the  range 150-675 AU, and find 11.8%__MATH_74__2.2% for the associations and 5.3%__MATH_75__0.8% in the ONC (for simplicity we here count a triple as two binaries). Both surveys represent  binary fractions, but the Reipurth & Zinnecker survey has negligible incompleteness correction in the chosen range. For our present survey, we have 9 line-of-sight pairs among our 78 binaries, and when we analyze their statistical distribution for different separations, we find that all 9 are likely to be found in the range 0__MATH_76__33 to 1__MATH_77__5. Of the 50 binaries in the range 150-675 AU we thus should count only 41 as physical binaries, leading to the abovementioned binary percentage of 5.3%. We thus find that the binary fraction in associations is higher by a factor of 2.2 compared to the ONC, in qualitative agreement with the study of Petr et al. (1998), who found a difference of almost a factor of 3 based on small-number statistics. __H3_6__ In Figure 6 we show the separation distribution of binaries towards the ONC on an angular scale and in bins 0__MATH_78__1 wide. The first bin from 0__MATH_79__1 to 0__MATH_80__2 is incomplete. It is striking that there is clear evidence for structure in the separation distribution function, with a sudden decrease in the number of binaries as the separations increase beyond 0__MATH_81__5, corresponding to 225 AU. At larger separations, the distribution is quite flat. We return to the physical interpretation of this “wall” in subsequent sections. An early precursor to this result may have been seen by Simon (1997), who studied the two-point correlation function in the ONC based on the results of Prosser et al. (1994) and noted a transition from binary companions to the large-scale cluster at projected separations around 400 AU. We have made the same plot on a logarithmic scale in Figure 7. The data are essentially complete over the whole separation range displayed. We have corrected the distribution for the 9 line-of-sight pairs by calculating the probability of finding another star within a circle with radius corresponding to the separations of each binary, and then adding these probabilities up for each bin. While such a procedure is meaningless for an individual object, it can be used to distribute the 9 false binaries across the 5 bins. Binaries with the largest separations are most likely to be line-of-sight pairs, and the last bin has a large correction of 6 stars, while three of the four remaining bins each is corrected for one star. Error bars are given for each corrected column. Figure 7 additionally shows the distribution of field stars in the same interval from Duquennoy & Mayor (1991). The dot-dash curve represents the Gaussian that Duquennoy & Mayor fitted to their entire data set, while the two dashed crosses represent their actual data points within our range. It is evident that the Gaussian is a poor fit to these data points in this specific separation interval. The Duquennoy & Mayor data are given as a function of period, and we have converted these to separations by assuming a mean total binary mass of 1.2 M__MATH_82__, appropriate for their sample of F7 to G9 binaries. We have also assumed, as is commonly done, that the projected separation represents the semimajor axis, although statistically there is a small difference (Kuiper 1935, Couteau 1960). As noted above, we find a binary frequency (after correcting for the 9 line-of-sight pairs and treating the three triples as six binaries) of 8.8%__MATH_83__1.1% in the interval from 67.5 AU to 675 AU. If we calculate the binary frequency from the Duquennoy & Mayor data in the same range, we find a binary frequency of 13.7% using a simple trapezoidal approximation to their log-normal curve, and 12.4% using linear interpolation of their data points. It follows that, in the specific range from 67.5 AU to 675 AU, there is approximately 1.5 times more binaries in the field than in the ONC. We discuss this result further below. __H3_7__ We have explored whether there is a difference in the number of wide binaries relative to close binaries as we move from the dense inner cluster regions to the outer reaches of the cluster. Such a difference has been searched for but not found in earlier studies (Köhler et al. 2006). In view of the dramatic change in the separation distribution function at 0__MATH_84__5, we have chosen this separation as a dividing point, such that we consider binaries between 0__MATH_85__15 and 0__MATH_86__5 as ‘close’ and binaries between 0__MATH_87__5 and 1__MATH_88__5 as ‘wide’. Figure 8 shows the cumulative distributions of these close and wide binaries as function of distance from __MATH_89__ Ori C in the Trapezium. It is evident from the figure that the two sets of binaries do not have the same radial distribution with increasing distance from the cluster core. To explore this further, we show in Figure 9 the ratio of wide to close binaries as a continuous cumulative distribution, with the first point calculated 30__MATH_90__ outside the exclusion zone, that is, at a distance of 90__MATH_91__ from __MATH_92__ Ori C. For each distance, the curve gives the ratio for all binaries from the edge of the exclusion zone to that particular distance. In other words, as the curve moves away from the Trapezium it accounts for more and more binaries, until the last points on the curve represent the mean ratio of wide-to-close binaries for the entire ONC. The dashed lines indicate the 1__MATH_93__ errors on the numbers. We have furthermore calculated the same ratio for the Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) binaries, and the two dotted lines indicate the values calculated from their Gaussian fit (lower line) and their actual data points (upper line). These lines thus represent the ratio for field stars. The curve does not take into account that 9 of the binaries are likely to be line-of-sight associations. Given that the probability of being a line-of-sight pair increases with separation and with proximity to the center of the ONC, it follows that the curve would dip even deeper down in the inner region if we could remove the 9 non-physical pairs. It is evident that there is a very pronounced and almost monotonic change in the ratio of wide to close binaries as one moves away from the core of the ONC until a distance of about 460__MATH_94__, at which point the ratio becomes flat. It is also clear that the mean ratio of wide to close binaries for the whole ONC is lower than the Duquennoy & Mayor values. We discuss the implications of these findings in Section 5. __H3_8__ In addition to the 72 binaries in the separation range from 0__MATH_95__15 to 1__MATH_96__5, we have found 3 triple systems with separations in the same range. Tokovinin (2001) suggests that the ratio of triples to binaries is 0.11__MATH_97__0.04 in general, whereas after subtracting the 9 line-of-sight pairs we find 0.048__MATH_98__0.01 in the ONC. Within the considerable errors the numbers are close to being consistent, but it should also be recalled that our survey is restricted to the limited range between the 0__MATH_99__15 completeness limit and the 1__MATH_100__5 confusion limit. It is entirely possible that some close pairs in triple systems have already evolved to become spectroscopic binaries and have thus become unobservable with our detection method. Nor can it be excluded that some wide pairs exist in triple systems with separations larger than 1__MATH_101__5, although such wide systems cannot be common (Scally et al. 1999). Much better statistics is required to settle the question whether the ONC might be deficient in triple systems. __H3_9__ We have determined the flux-ratios of those of our binaries that are not saturated in our images. Figure 10 shows the resulting histogram as a function of __MATH_102__mag. As is well established from other binary studies, the majority of binaries in the ONC also have unequal components, although the bin with equal components (__MATH_103__m __MATH_104__ 0.5 mag.) is the most populated. Only very few of the companions have a magnitude difference to their primary of more than 2.5 magnitudes. In the absence of spectroscopic information, we have made a crude attempt to investigate the nature of the companions based on their measured flux ratios. In order to do that we have made some assumptions. First, we assume that the observed flux ratios reflect the photospheric fluxes, in other words that H__MATH_105__ emission line fluxes are not seriously affecting the ratios. This may not always be a good assumption, since mid-to-late M dwarfs often are very active, and their photospheric fluxes are so low that H__MATH_106__ line emission could be a significant contribution. If we mistake H__MATH_107__ line emission for photospheric flux from the primary, our estimate of a spectral type for a companion will be earlier than it is in reality. Second, most published photometry of late-type dwarfs is broad-band, whereas we have observed in the narrow-band H__MATH_108__ filter, so we assume that our observed magnitude differences can be compared to R-band photometry. Since we are dealing with the difference between two stars, this is probably not a bad assumption, at least when the flux ratio is not large. Third, we assume that the observed flux ratios are not affected by differences in extinction between the components. Given the young age and occasional association with molecular clouds, this may not in all cases hold true. With these caveats spelled out, we have used the M__MATH_109__ vs spectral type relation and the R-I colors for M dwarfs (e.g., Dahn et al. 2002) to derive the difference in R-band magnitudes as a function of spectral type for M-dwarfs. The relation turns out to be essentially linear, with a mean drop of 0.56 magnitudes per spectral subtype throughout the M spectral range. We then used the spectral classifications for the primaries provided by SIMBAD, of mixed provenance, with our flux ratios to estimate a spectral type for the secondaries. For a cluster with an age between 0.5 and 3 Myr, the substellar limit is around spectral type M6.25 following the models of Baraffe et al. (1998) and Chabrier et al. (2000) and using the temperature scale of Luhman et al. (2003), see also Luhman et al. (2006). To our surprise, quite a number of the secondaries appear to be brown dwarfs, in at least one case forming a wide BD-BD binary. We comment on selected cases in the Appendix. Given the assumptions involved and the simplistic nature of these spectral type estimates, it is obvious that spectroscopy is required to establish the true nature of the secondaries. __H2_4__ __H3_10__ The separation distribution function of field binaries has been approximated by various functions. Öpik (1924) suggested that binaries with separations larger than __MATH_110__60 AU follow a  distribution, whereas Kuiper (1942) proposed that the overall distribution could be represented by a Gaussian. The latter distribution was adopted as a good fit to their data in the influential study by Duquennoy & Mayor (1991), although it is evident from Figure 7 that in the specific separation range discussed in the present paper, the Gaussian is a poor approximation to the actual data. Integrating the Öpik relation over logarithmic bins results in a straight horizontal line to describe the logarithmic separation distribution, and this is clearly a better fit to the two data points of Duquennoy & Mayor seen in Figure 7. The Öpik relation has also been supported by numerous studies summarized by Poveda & Allen (2004). For the separation distribution of ONC binaries (corrected for line-of-sight associations) both a Gaussian and a horizontal line provide acceptable fits to the data when considering the uncertainties of the data points. It is thus not possible to classify the structure of the ONC separation distribution function with the available data. The separation distribution function in the ONC most probably has not yet found its final shape. Two basic mechanisms operate that can affect the orbit of a young binary: rapid dynamical decay in small-N clusters (e.g., Sterzik & Durisen 1998, Reipurth & Clarke 2001, Bate et al. 2002) and the passage of a binary through a dense cluster (e.g., Kroupa 1995a,b, Kroupa et al. 1999). The former occurs primarily during the Class 0 phase (Reipurth 2000), and is no longer relevant for stars in the ONC. The latter, however, may be essential for understanding the binary population of the ONC. A wide binary falling through the potential well of a cluster will gain kinetic energy through encounters, and binaries with weak binding energies are eventually disrupted (Heggie 1975). A prediction of this scenario is that binaries at distances from the cluster center larger than the corresponding crossing time should not be showing any dynamical alterations due to encounters with other cluster members (Kroupa et al. 1999, 2001). The crossing time of a star through a cluster is __MATH_111__, where __MATH_112__ is the cluster radius and __MATH_113__ is the mean one-dimensional velocity dispersion in the cluster. Assuming that this velocity dispersion in the ONC is of the order of 2 km s__MATH_114__ (e.g., Jones & Walker 1988), we have in Figure 9 indicated the crossing time for different distances to the cluster center. The figure suggests that for distances larger than roughly 460 arcsec there is no longer a measurable change in the ratio of wide-to-close binaries. Given that the wide-to-close binary ratio changes by a factor of 4-5 from the inner to the outer regions, this suggests that many, and perhaps most, of the wide binaries are disrupted after only a few passages of the cluster center. The variation of the ratio of wide-to-close binaries from the inner to the outer regions of the ONC, seen in Figure 9, offers the first compelling observational evidence that dynamical interactions in the dense central region of the ONC have taken place. In principle, the diagram in Figure 9 allows us to determine the age of the ONC. An angular distance of __MATH_115__460 arcsec corresponds to a crossing time of about 1 million years. However, an age determined in this manner is directly dependent on the velocity dispersion assumed. Therefore, all we can say about the age of 1 million years we estimate for the ONC is that it is consistent with other ONC age estimates (e.g., Hillenbrand 1997). The significantly lower number of binaries that we find in the ONC compared to associations thus appears to be due, at least in part, dissolution of wide binaries. However, under certain circumstances an encounter could lead to hardening of the binary, making it closer than our resolution limit, so it is not lost to the overall binary budget. Even in its outermost regions, the ONC shows a smaller ratio of wide-to-close binaries than seen in the field by Duquennoy & Mayor (1991). Considering that the majority of field stars are likely to have been formed in a cluster, it follows that many of the  binaries in the field must have formed in the gentler environment of a loose T association. Durisen & Sterzik (1994) found, on theoretical grounds, that binaries are more likely to form in clouds with lower temperatures. Reipurth & Zinnecker (1993) found observational evidence that clouds with more stars have relatively fewer binaries in the separation range under study (mostly wide visual binaries). Both these results could indicate that loose T associations produce or retain more wide binaries than do clusters. However, Brandeker et al. (2006) noted that the young sparse __MATH_116__ Chamaeleontis cluster has a deficit of wide binaries. Unless this small cluster is the remnant of a much denser cluster, then this result would seem to be in contradiction to the notion that wide binaries are preferentially formed/preserved in loose associations. In any case, there is no question that the field binary population is a mix of binaries formed in clusters and in associations. We can attempt to calculate the fraction of stars that originate in clusters and in associations. In Sect. 4.2 we showed that, in the limited separation range 67.5 - 675 AU, the binary fraction of the field stars of Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) is about a factor 1.5 higher than in the ONC. We also found that in the range 150 - 675 AU associations have a factor 2.2 more binaries than the ONC. In other words, in these limited ranges associations have about 1.5 times as many binaries as the field population, and the ONC has only about 2/3 as many binaries as the field population. It follows that the field star binary population in principle can be produced if only 1/3 of binaries come from the binary-rich associations and 2/3 originate in binary-poor ONC-type clusters, in excellent agreement with the results of Patience et al. (2002) and in approximate agreement with findings that 70-90% of all stars may be formed in clusters (e.g., Lada & Lada 2003). Of course, this assumes that the binary ratios between field stars, associations, and the ONC derived here within narrow separation ranges can be extrapolated to all separations, an assumption that may not hold at all. __H3_11__ As noted in Sect. 4.5, spectroscopy is required to determine the true nature of the companions we have found. However, unless significant extinction differences are common among our binaries, then the difference in component brightness, combined with spectral type estimates for the primaries when available, are indicative of the spectral types of the secondaries. While this is highly uncertain in individual cases, overall it is likely to be indicative of the properties of the companion population. Table 1 lists the spectral types for 46 primaries, and of these 38, or 83%, are M-type stars. We find that more than half (25) of these 46 binary stars have secondaries with spectral types of M5 or later, and about one third (17) could be substellar. These numbers are upper limits, since we cannot correct for the 9 false binaries that we expect to be present in our sample of 78 multiple systems, but they are probably more likely to be found among pairs with faint, widely separated companions. However, even if we subtracted all 9 objects from the 17 that could be substellar, this would still indicate that 8, or about 17%, of the 46 binaries with spectral type estimates are likely to have substellar companions. Selected cases are discussed in the Appendix. The closest binaries we were able to resolve with our imaging technique have projected separations of 50 AU. All of the binaries with likely substellar companions are thus quite wide, which is of interest for formation theories (see, e.g., Lucas et al. 2005, and reviews by Burgasser et al. 2007, Luhman et al. 2007, Whitworth et al. 2007). It is likely that there are several brown dwarf – brown dwarf binaries in our binary sample, but the only one that we are certain of is COUP 1061. Infrared spectroscopy of this source indicates a spectral type of M9-L0 (Meeus & McCaughrean 2005). We have resolved this object into two components with almost equal brightness and a projected separation of 100 AU. Brown dwarf binaries with such large separations are rare (e.g., Lucas et al. 2005, Allen et al. 2007), although a few very wide pairs are known (e.g., Artigau et al. 2007, Barrado y Navascués et al. 2007). __H2_5__ We have analyzed a large set of H__MATH_117__ images of the Orion Nebula Cluster acquired with the Hubble Space Telescope and the Advanced Camera for Surveys with the goal of detecting binaries among a sample of 781 ONC members. The following results were obtained: 1. A total of 75 binaries and 3 triple systems were detected, of which 55 are new discoveries. 2. Within the limited angular range of 0__MATH_118__15 to 1__MATH_119__5, corresponding to projected separations of 67.5 AU to 675 AU, we have found a binary fraction of 8.8%__MATH_120__1.1% after correcting for a statistically determined contamination of 9 line-of-sight binaries. 3. The field binary fraction for solar type stars in the same separation range is 1.5 times larger, and for T Tauri associations it is 2.2 times larger than in the ONC, confirming earlier results that the ONC is deficient in binaries, now with statistically significant data. 4. The separation distribution function for young binaries in the ONC shows a dramatic decrease in binaries for angular separations larger than 0.5__MATH_121__, corresponding to projected separations of 225 AU. 5. The ratio of cumulative distributions of wide (0__MATH_122__5 to 1__MATH_123__5) to close (0__MATH_124__15 to 0__MATH_125__5) binaries show an increase out to a distance of about 460__MATH_126__ from the center of the ONC, after which it levels out. We interpret this as clear observational evidence for dynamical evolution of the binary population as a result of passages through the potential well of the ONC. These results are consistent with an age of the ONC of about 1 million yr. 6. It appears that much of the deficiency of binaries in the ONC compared to the field star population can be understood, at least in part, in terms of the destruction of wide binaries combined with a secondary effect from orbital evolution of binaries towards closer separations that are unobservable in direct imaging surveys. 7. Limited spectral information about the primary stars indicate that they are low mass T Tauri stars (except for one Herbig Ae/Be star). Assuming that most binaries are not affected by differential extinction, we find that possibly as many as 50% of the binaries have companions with spectral types later than M5, and from 1/6 to 1/3 of the binaries may have substellar companions, all of which with separations of at least 50 AU. This large number of wide substellar companions is of interest for theories of brown dwarf formation.
