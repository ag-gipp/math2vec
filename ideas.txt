1) merge all together
2) skip sentence/paragraph if it contains too long Math
3) cut off too long math (trim it to 4 symbols max, for example)
4) cut out groups (in sums for example), merge groups (subscripts for example) etc.

wait until see the results:
* other thing, user _ instead of -
* math problems above
